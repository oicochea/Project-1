# Project-1


I created this project due to my liking and affinities for brewerys. 
Many brewerys have opened up recently and at times you can find it hard to remeber how your experience was or even decide which one to go to.

My project takes the user input of their zip code and returns to them a randomly selected brewery in their zip code area. 
We Pull from the API the adress, name, email, phone nunmber and push through the google image API an image of the brewery.

We then give the user the ability to drag and drop the brewery's name into a list of liked or disliked, this allows us to create a profile in where the user can create a running list of their favorite brewrys and not so favorite ones, we also give our recommended pics from our locations in case the user is around our area.

I used the Beer Icon from the ULICONS to make it "fun" and on theme, The drag and drop features sessembles that of an tinder or Bumble swipe functions as it is an easy drag left or drag right functions. 

We give the user the abilty to click into theit creates list and see what they have added previously.

Currenyly I am attemting to connect the good maps API and have the user click the Maps icon and me pass the address through, same as the phone number icon.
